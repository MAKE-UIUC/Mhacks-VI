It takes a huge amount of time and effort to put together a good presentation. Sometimes the presenter simply does not have the time to put in this time and effort. Somes the presentation simply needs to be winged. Until now, it has not been feesable to create a slide deck for a winged presentation. We're going to try to fix this problem.

Using vocal transcription and NLP, streampoint generates a slidedeck for the presenter as he tells his story. With content powered by the Bing Image API, Stream, WolframAlpha, and Azure, we enable you to show the audience your ideas without looking up anything, demonstrate physical components without passing anything around, and impress your crowd without memorizing (or knowing for that matter) a single fact.
